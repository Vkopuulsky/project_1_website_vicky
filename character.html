<h1>The Main Characters</h1>
<p>Every show has at least one main character. In Pretty Litttle Liars,
there are 5 main characters. Those main characters are: Alison Dilaurentis,
Emily Fields, Hanna Marin, Spencer Hastings, Aria Montgomery. (Personally
my favorite pretty little liars is Spencer Hastings.) While Alison herself
is forced to go into hiding to protect herself, the other girls learn more
secrets about Ali then they intended to.</p>
<h2> Alison Dilaurentis</h2>

<p>Alison was the 'It Girl' and Queen Bee of Rosewood's teenage social
circle, who was best friends with Hanna, Aria, Spencer, and Emily prior
to her disappearance the night of September 1, 2009. Out of the girls,
she is considered pretty, manipulative, secretive, devilish and
vindictive. Despite her sometimes malicious behavior toward others, she
can make them feel very special, and is known by her close friends to
have a sweet and caring side. The daughter Alison's parents knew,
though fiercely independent and recklessly obstinate when challenged,
was never the girl hated and feared by many. She never had a close
relationship with her brother, Jason DiLaurentis ,and they often fought.
Although Alison seemed to have the perfect life, she was being harassed
by a mysterious text-messenger named "A", shortly before her death.</p>

<h2 id="emily">Emily Fiellds</h2>

<p>Emily Fields is the 'jock' of the group because of her aptitude in
swimming, which makes her the star of Rosewood's swim team. Out of
the girls, Emily would be described as caring, sweet and loyal.
Emily cares so much about her friends that she does anything she can
to keep them safe. She is an only child, therefore the center to
her parents life. Although Emily has been through many difficulties, (such as
the death of her ex-girlfriend Maya St.Germain), she always seems to stay strong and comes out on top.
Emily is considered the weakest link by "A."</p

<h2 id="hanna">Hanna Marin</h2>

width="500" height="auto">
<p>Hanna used to be overweight prior to Alison's disappearance.
Despite being the sweetest of the bunch, she was constantly
made fun of by Alison for being overweight, calling her Hefty
Hanna. After Alison went missing, Hanna befriended Mona and lost weight and
became popular over the summer. The newly minted queen bee, Hanna, wins
Homecoming Queen but is constantly reminded by A of her dorky days as "Hefty Hanna".
Even though Hanna is one of the most popular and prettiest girls at school,
she is generous and kind. She is the boldest and the most outspoken of the four
girls often making snarky comments, not afraid to say what she really thinks of
a person. However, she is very gullible and ends up trusting people easily.

<h2 id="spencer">Spencer Hastings</h2>

<p>Spencer Hastings is a highly intelligent, overachieving and extremely wealthy
 young woman. She constantly balances many jobs; such as internships, charity
 work, being part of the field hockey team, and after-school clubs. She is
 confident, calculating and would stand up to Alison when no one else could,
 showing her determination and courage. Spencer's family can prove to be
 difficult. Her parents are very demanding, while her aggravating sister,
 Melissa, is constantly outshining her and winning their parents' scarce
 approval. With her fiercely competitive nature, Spencer doesn't demand anything
  less than perfection.</p>

<h2 id="aria">Aria Monttgomery</h2>
<img id="ariam" src="http://images.tvfanatic.com/iu/v1371225181/aria-montgomery-photo.png"
width="500" height="auto">
<p>Aria Montgomery was the artsy and alternative girl in Alison's clique prior
  to her disappearance, sporting pink streaks in her hair. Alison and Aria
  discovered Aria's father's affair with a college student, Meredith Sorenson,
  one afternoon while running away from the nerdy Mona Vanderwaal, and found
  him kissing Meredith in his car. Ever since, Alison used the affair to keep
  Aria in line, knowing Aria was asked to keep it a secret. Her constant teasing
  about the indiscretion led Aria to resent Alison. Shortly after Ali's
  disappearance, Aria moved to Iceland for a year, and came back, sans pink
  highlights, becoming more mature. She meets her future English teacher Ezra
  Fitz in a bar, hooking up with him, leading to an on-again off-again
  relationship throughout the series due to A's threats. Due to the loose
  connection she and Ali shared, she is not a frequent target of A, but is still
   forced to deal with the misfortunes A brings upon her (ruining her
   relationships, driving a wedge between her parents). She can be described as
   a kind and caring friend, always willing to protect them from any threats "A"
    has.</p.
