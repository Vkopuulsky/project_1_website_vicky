    <h1>The Main Characters</h1>
    <p>Every show has at least one main character. In Pretty Litttle Liars,
      there are 5 main characters. Those main characters are: Alison Dilaurentis,
      Emily Fields, Hanna Marin, Spencer Hastings, Aria Montgomery. (Personally
      my favorite pretty little liars is Spencer Hastings.) While Alison herself
      is forced to go into hiding to protect herself, the other girls learn more
      secrets about Ali then they intended to.</p>
      <h2> Alison Dilaurentis</h2>

      <p>Alison was the 'It Girl' and Queen Bee of Rosewood's teenage social
      circle, who was best friends with Hanna, Aria, Spencer, and Emily prior
      to her disappearance the night of September 1, 2009. Out of the girls,
      she is considered pretty, manipulative, secretive, devilish and
      vindictive. Despite her sometimes malicious behavior toward others, she
      can make them feel very special, and is known by her close friends to
      have a sweet and caring side. The daughter Alison's parents knew,
      though fiercely independent and recklessly obstinate when challenged,
      was never the girl hated and feared by many. She never had a close
      relationship with her brother, Jason DiLaurentis ,and they often fought.
      Although Alison seemed to have the perfect life, she was being harassed
      by a mysterious text-messenger named "A", shortly before her death.</p>

          <p>Emily Fields is the 'jock' of the group because of her aptitude in
            swimming, which makes her the star of Rosewood's swim team. Out of
            the girls, Emily would be described as caring, sweet and loyal.
            Emily cares so much about her friends that she does anything she can
             to keep them safe. She is an only child, therefore the center to
             her parents life. Although Emily has been through many
             difficulties, (such as the death of her ex-girlfriend Maya St.
             Germain), she always seems to stay strong and comes out on top.
             Emily is considered the weakest link by "A."
