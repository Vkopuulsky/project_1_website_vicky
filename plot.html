    <p>"A" is the main antagonist of the series. "A" is an anonymous character
      who sends threatening messages to Alison DiLaurentis, Aria Montgomery,
      Spencer Hastings, Hanna Marin, Emily Fields and, in some cases, Mona
      Vanderwaal. The first and original "A" was revealed to be Mona Vanderwaal
      in "UnmAsked", who was the primary antagonist for the first two seasons.

Big A is the person who stole the game from Mona and played it from Season 3 to
Season 6. In "Game Over, Charles", CeCe Drake was revealed to be "Big A" using
her birth name, Charles DiLaurentis. After being discovered and a failed suicide
 attempt, she declares "game over".

Five years later, after Charlotte's murder, Uber A starts stalking and sending

blackmailing texts to the four Liars in order to find out who killed Charlotte.
This new stalker, however, does not use the pseudonym of "-A", even if they are
a copycat. They also start using emoji's in their texts as a signature.</p>

<h1>Who is Uber A</h1>
<p>The A-Team is a secret group of people who use the pseudonym "A" to threaten
  Alison DiLaurentis, Aria Montgomery, Hanna Marin, Spencer Hastings, and Emily
  Fields. Mona Vanderwaal was a member of the "A-Team", as revealed in
  "UnmAsked", Toby Cavanaugh was a member of the "A-Team", as revealed in "The
  Lady Killer", Spencer Hastings was also a member of the "A-Team", as revealed
  in "I'm Your Puppet". As revealed in the episode "The First Secret", the
  A-Team was created in October 2008.

When Mona was revealed to be Original "A", she tried to convince Spencer
Hastings to join, what she referred to as the "A-Team". She also alludes to it
when she says "You had to earn it, the right to be a part of it". After, Spencer
asks her what she's going to do now, because "doesn't 'A' always have a plan?"
Mona replies with "Yes, she does", refering to herself. After Mona was admitted
into Radley Sanitarium, we hear in her mind that everything is going exactly as
they planned. A mysterious person in a red jacket visited her and Mona told her
that she did everything she told her to do. From that moment, Red Coat stole the
 game from her.

When Toby Cavanaugh was revealed to be helping Mona, there were plans alluded
that referred to a mysterious phone call, that never got made. Also, it was
mentioned that if he and Mona knew that Nate was going to have Garrett Reynolds
 "off the hook" for Maya's murder then they would have done things differently.
 Toby's motives for being involved in the "A-Team" were to "keep Spencer safe"
 as revealed in "A DAngerous GAme".

The A-Team as of "Game Over, Charles" has consisted of Charlotte (formerly
adressed as Charles), Sara, Spencer, Mona, Toby, Lucas, Melissa and Wilden
(according to Mona).

After Uber A had started to torment the girls five years later, a second A-Team
 (unofficial name) was borned from the ashes of the old, It thus far, consists
 of: Uber A, Mary Drake and Elliott Rollins.</p>

   <h1>Sample Stories</h1>
   <h2>Pilot</h2>
   <p>"A" begins her game when she texts all four of the Liars pretending to be
     Alison. At the funeral, each of the girls realize the other three also
     received texts from "A" and then they all receive a single text together.</p>
<h2>To Kill a Mocking Girl</h2>
<p>When The Liars are in the woods heading to their old hangout and discussing
  Ali and "A", they hear a noise and then receive a text message.
Heads up, BFFs. It's open season on liars and I'm hunting... --A
The Liars are once again heading back to their old hangout and discussing Ali,
when they hear another noise. They chase after it but find nothing but Ali's old
bracelet. We then see a black gloved figure listening to music while printing
out incriminating photos of Maya and Emily kissing.</p>
<h2>Can You Hear Me Now?</h2>
<p>The Liars block all text messages from unknown numbers in order to keep "A"
  out but its not enough to keep her away and suddenly a flier blows their way
  and its apparently from "A". They all get up and leave.</p>
<h2>Keep Your Friends Close</h2>
<p>The Liars go to Mona's birthday party to look for "A".
While spying in the woods, Hanna sees a figure writing an "A" like message on
Ezra's car and sees the persons identity. She tells the Liars and runs to the
parking lot to meet them. Hanna arrives at the parking lot where the others are
and begins to run over to them. However, Hanna is unaware of a car speeding
towards her until the Liars scream to her. The car plows into her and knocks
her in unconscious. The Liars rush over to her and receive a text: "She knew
too much. -- A".
Moments Later
"A" stops the car down the road and gets out and takes off running. A few
moments later, Mona, in a black hoodie, walks up to the scene.</p>
